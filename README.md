To set up the code you provided in a new system, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install Required Packages:
   Ensure that you have Python installed on your new system. You can download and install Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). The code you provided uses the `pyodbc` library for working with SQL Server databases and `tkinter` for creating a GUI. Install these packages using pip:

   ```
   pip install pyodbc
   ```

2. Icon File (Optional):
   The code attempts to set an application icon using the line `root.iconbitmap("sync.ico")`. If you have an icon file named "sync.ico," you should place it in the same directory as your Python script. If you don't have an icon file, you can remove this line, and the application will run without an icon.

3. Review Code Configuration:
   The code expects to read and write database connection configurations to a file named "db_config.txt" in the same directory as the script. If this file doesn't exist, you can enter the connection details manually. If you have a previous configuration file, you can place it in the same directory.

4. Run the Script:
   Execute the Python script you provided in your new system. This script will open a GUI for configuring source and target database connections and initiating data synchronization.

5. Configure Source and Target Connections:
   Fill in the required database connection details for the source and target databases. You can either enter the details manually or load a configuration if you have the "db_config.txt" file.

6. Save Configuration:
   After entering the database connection details, you can click the "Save Configuration" button to save the details to the "db_config.txt" file for future use.

7. Start Data Synchronization:
   Once the source and target connections are configured, you can click the "Start Processing" button to initiate data synchronization. The code will attempt to synchronize data from the source to the target database.

8. Monitor Progress:
   The code provides a text widget for displaying logs and an animation to indicate that synchronization is in progress. You can monitor the progress and any potential errors in the GUI.

9. Close the Application:
   After the data synchronization is complete or if you want to exit the application, you can close the GUI window. The code allows you to start another synchronization or make changes to the configuration as needed.

Make sure you have the necessary permissions and network access to connect to the source and target databases. Additionally, ensure that your SQL Server is properly configured to accept connections.

If you encounter any issues or errors during setup or execution, please provide more specific details about the problems you face for further assistance.
